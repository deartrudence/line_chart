		//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		// **** THE SETUP ****

		//  --> SPACING AND SIZES

		// Find minium and maximum values for hours in the bikeshare array
	

	

		// Set up the spacing and sizing for the graph
		// Use the margin convention practice 
		


		// --> SCALES


		// 5. X scale will use the number of elements
		// Scale band creates equally spaced points
		// in this case there are 12 months and 12 datapoints (ie bikeshare.length)
		// So, scaleBand spreads each datapoint out equally along the X axis (we use this function later when defniing the X axis)


		


		// 6. Y scale will use the duration_in_hours datapoint
		// Scale linear takes in the values from the dataset as the domain and scales it down (or up) to fit within the graph
		// We're using this for the Y axis, so we want it to fit within the height.
		// Also, we're using minDuration - 5000 and maxDuration + 5000, so that our datapoints don't touch the very top or bottom of the page (this is just visually pleasing)


		


		// --> GENERATE LINE

		// 7. d3's line generator
		// this generator essentially loops through each data object in the array
		// This sets the x values and the y values for the points that will make up the line
		// For x we use the xScale, and since it's concerned with just the number of elements we pass it in the index value
		// For y we use the yScale and it is concerned with the duration, so we pass in the duration_in_hours fromt the data object
		//++++
		// You may notice that we're not actually referencing the data in any way here.
		// That is because we're creating a variable 'line', which will be a function, based on the info we give it.
		// Later when create the actual SVG, we will will call this function to create the line
		// note, i'm using the return here b/c of the console.log, there is no longer an implicit return.
		




		//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		// **** PUT IT ON THE PAGE ****

		//  --> CREATE SVG

		// 1. Add the SVG to the page 
		// Here we're telling d3 to grab the element with the id of chart and append an svg to it.
		// Then we give it height and width attributes.  We use the height and width we set above and also add the margins we set above.
		// The reason we need the margins is that we need room for the axes labels.  And it's also nice to have a bit of padding around the chart itself
		// in this example the chart size plus margin is the white space
		// You'll notice that we also apend a 'g', g in svgs are for grouping and we'll be adding all the details of the chart into this group

		


		//  --> X-AXIS

		// 3. Call the x axis in a group tag
		// We create a group and translate it to the bottom of the chart using the height attribute
		// since everything in an SVG starts at the top left corner,  translating it the height will put it at the bottom of the chart.
		// Then we set the axisBottom using the xScale we created above
		//Finally we add ticks to the axis with the value of the month
		


		//  --> Y-AXIS

		// 4. Call the y axis in a group tag

		

		// --> ADD LINE

		// 9. Append the path, bind the data, and call the line generator
		
		    

		// --> ADD DOTS

		// 12. Appends a circle for each datapoint 


		

		    // MOUSEOVER FOR TOOLTIP

		    // need function here cuz using (this)
